					<p>The American Spaniards have long been in the habit of making presents of islands to deserving individuals. The pilot Juan Fernandez procured a deed of the isle named after him, and for some years resided there before Selkirk came. It is supposed, however, that he eventually contracted the blues upon his princely property, for after a time he returned to the main, and as report goes, became a very garrulous barber in the city of Lima. <a href="the-encantadas.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>They who may be disposed to question the possibility of the character above depicted, are referred to the 2nd <abbr>vol.</abbr> of Porter’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Voyage Into the Pacific</i>, where they will recognize many sentences, for expedition’s sake derived verbatim from thence, and incorporated here; the main difference⁠—save a few passing reflections⁠—between the two accounts being, that the present writer has added to Porter’s facts accessory ones picked up in the Pacific from reliable sources; and where facts conflict, has naturally preferred his own authorities to Porter’s. As, for instance, <em>his</em> authorities place Oberlus on Hood’s Isle: Porter’s, on Charles’s Isle. The letter found in the hut is also somewhat different; for while at the Encantadas he was informed that, not only did it evince a certain clerkliness, but was full of the strangest satiric effrontery which does not adequately appear in Porter’s version. I accordingly altered it to suit the general character of its author. <a href="the-encantadas.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
